First, a tentative assumption is made about the parameter or distribution. This assumption is called the null hypothesis and is denoted by $H_0$. An alternative hypothesis (denoted $H_a$), which is the opposite of what is stated in the null hypothesis, is then defined. The hypothesis-testing procedure involves using sample data to determine whether or not $H_0$ can be rejected. If $H_0$ is rejected, the statistical conclusion is that the alternative hypothesis $H_a$ is true.\n",
